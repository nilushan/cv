% Technical Case Study - New section showcasing problem-solving
\section{TECHNICAL CASE STUDY: SCALING IOT PLATFORM}

\noindent When our IoT platform reached 30,000 connected devices, we began experiencing critical performance issues:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Message processing latency increased exponentially during peak hours, database connections were regularly exhausted, and cloud costs were growing unsustainably.
    
    \item \textbf{Analysis:} Profiling revealed bottlenecks in the message broker, inefficient database queries, and poor connection pooling. Additionally, the monolithic architecture limited our ability to scale components independently.
    
    \item \textbf{Solution Approach:} Implemented a three-phase solution:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Redesigned data storage with time-series optimization and query caching
        \item Replaced synchronous operations with event-driven processing
        \item Decomposed monolith into independently scalable microservices
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Engineering Process:} Created detailed architecture documentation, implemented comprehensive performance tests, deployed changes incrementally with feature flags, and established real-time monitoring.
    
    \item \textbf{Results:} Achieved 99.999\% uptime during migration, reduced latency by 85\%, cut infrastructure costs by 50\%, and created a platform capable of handling more than 100 events per second.
\end{itemize}
